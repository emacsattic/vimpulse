;;; Installation:

;; If you checked out from Git, do `make all' to produce
;; vimpulse-big.el.  If on Windows, you can run compile.bat.  Then:
;;
;; 1. Copy vimpulse.el (or vimpulse-big.el) to somewhere in your
;;    load-path, e.g., your site-lisp directory.
;;
;; 2. Comment out and add the following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;;        (require 'vimpulse)
;;
;;    If .emacs does not exist, create it.  If you use Windows,
;;    see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html.
;;
;; That's all the required steps.  The rest is optional:
;;
;; 3. For linear undo/redo and undo branches, install
;;    undo-tree.el: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree.
;;
;; Vimpulse automatically enables Viper.  You can temporarily disable
;; Viper (and Vimpulse) with the C-z key.
