;;; News:

;; Version 0.4+git [2010-06-??]
;;  [vegard_oye at hotmail.com:]
;;  - [NEW] :undolist or :ul shows the undo history as a tree. This
;;    uses undo-tree.el, which replaces redo.el for undo/redo.
;;    Get undo-tree.el from: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree
;;  - [NEW] / and ? use isearch. Matches are highlighted while typing;
;;    also, isearch keystrokes applies, like C-w to yank the text
;;    under cursor. See `isearch-forward' for more details.
;;  - [NEW] If `viper-auto-indent' is t, RET extends the comment
;;    prefix to the next line (with `comment-indent-new-line' from
;;    newcomment.el).
;;  - [NEW] Keys: gi, g$, g0.
;;  - [NEW] C-w has its own prefix map, `vimpulse-window-map'.
;;  - [NEW] Lower-case marks are buffer-local -- thanks, Štěpán Němec.
;;  - [FIX] Replace mode's appearance is now more similar to Vim's.
;;  - [FIX] Byte compilation errors.
;;  - [FIX] Various bugs submitted to the mailing list --
;;    thanks, everyone.
;;  - To pacify the compiler, all variables are initially defined
;;    in one place.
;;  - For readability and consistency, "Yoda conditions" are
;;    universally banned: e.g., (= var 0), not (= 0 var).
;;  - Furthermore, all "level two" comments (;;) are full sentences.
;;
;; Version 0.4 [2010-04-26]
;;  [vegard_oye at hotmail.com:]
;;  - [NEW] Operator-Pending mode: the cursor's appearance
;;    changes temporarily after y, d, c, etc.
;;  - [NEW] Motion type system: one can change how a motion is
;;    "interpreted" with v, V and C-v. For example, dvj will
;;    delete a characterwise range (the default is linewise).
;;  - [NEW] Keys: gq, gu, gU, g~, g?.
;;  - [NEW] Keybinding functions: `vimpulse-omap' and
;;    `vimpulse-omap-local'.
;;  - [FIX] Vimpulse's text objects handle whitespace
;;    more like Vim's.
;;  - [FIX] Various bugs submitted to the mailing list --
;;    thanks, everyone.
;;  - The code for applying an "operator" like d to a "motion"
;;    like w is completely rewritten. Operators are simple
;;    to define (with `vimpulse-range'), and can be applied
;;    to regular Emacs movement commands as well.
;;  - The text objects have been redefined in terms of the new
;;    framework. They are implemented as selection commands;
;;    see the `vimpulse-define-text-object' macro for details.
;;  - The code for adding Viper states is generalized.
;;    Both Visual mode and Operator-Pending mode are
;;    defined with the `vimpulse-define-state' macro.
;;  - The comments use a more conventional format: ;;;; for major
;;    headings (one per file), ;;; for subsections (within each file),
;;    ;; for individual pieces of code and ; for trailing comments.
;;    This is easier to maintain and complies with section D.7 of
;;    the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.
;;
;; Version 0.3.1 [2010-03-09]
;;  [vegard_oye at hotmail.com:]
;;  - [NEW] Emacs-compatible Visual selection.
;;    It is now a Viper state proper, with a user map
;;    and a major mode extension map.
;;    [NEW] Visual keys: u, U, ~, >, <, J, O, gv --
;;    thanks, Frank Fischer.
;;  - [NEW] Movement keys: C-o, C-i, C-w hjkl, gb, gd, N%, +, _.
;;  - [NEW] Keybinding functions: `vimpulse-map',
;;    `vimpulse-imap' and `vimpulse-vmap'.
;;  - [NEW] Backspace in Replace mode restores text.
;;  - [NEW] Basic vi navigation in help buffers.
;;  - [NEW] Vimpulse has its own customization group.
;;  - [FIX] Improved text objects support, including Visual mode.
;;  - [FIX] Various bugs listed at EmacsWiki or submitted to the
;;    mailing list or bug tracker -- thanks.
;;  - All Vimpulse bindings are now in `viper-vi-basic-map',
;;    leaving `viper-vi-global-user-map' for the user.
;;    The same is true of Visual mode.
;;  - Easier installation. rect-mark.el is no longer needed,
;;    nor is cl.el.
;;  - All tabs are replaced by spaces.
;;  - The file encoding is UTF-8.
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;;  - Added some small fixes, and promoted the experimental stuff to
;;    stable, as it seems to work well and not loading it caused
;;    problems.
;;
;; Version 0.3.0 [2009-07-03]
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;;  - [NEW] Register support on text object commands.
;;  - [NEW] Issuing : in Visual mode has a behavior closer
;;    to Vim's.
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - [FIX] The Enter key now does what it should do -- insert a
;;    newline -- even when longlines-mode is on.
;;  - Comment changes.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.9 [2009-06-24]
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;; - [FIX & NEW] Text objects support fixed and integrated with Viper.
;;   Now count works (e.g., you can do 3caw and it works correctly),
;;   and it's possible to repeat the commands with ".".
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.8 [2009-06-22]
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;; - [NEW] Text object support: paren blocks, sentences, word, Words,
;;   quoted expressions, paragraphs. Delete and change commands.
;;   Example commands: diw, ci(, das, etc.
;; - [FIX] It's now possible to exit Visual mode by pressing the
;;   ESC key or ^[.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.7
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - No code changes.
;;  - Fixed up "thanks" section below to mention Mieszko
;;    <sillyfox at yahoo.com>'s full name. He wrote a small patch
;;    which was included long ago. I must have forgotten to include it
;;    in the changelog.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.6
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;; - Fixed pasting in Visual mode, works like in Vim now
;;   (experimental, see point 6 of installation instructions).
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.5
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;; - Fixed some major suckage with the change command. Still alpha,
;;   comments welcome. To use it, see the installation instructions,
;;   point 6 (it's still experimental).
;; - Cleaned namespace, hope there are no hidden bugs.
;; - Fixed loading on Emacs snapshot.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.4
;;  [laynor at gmail.com:]
;;  - This can probably be considered a major release.
;;  - [FIX & NEW] Rewritten Visual mode, v and V variants (no
;;    changes to Visual Block still). It does not use the region like
;;    before: highlighting is done through overlays, and the region is
;;    set inside the command code before calling the Viper commands.
;;    = in Visual mode calls `vimpulse-visual-indent-command'. The
;;    Visual mode (apart from Block mode) looks and feels like Vim.
;;  - [NEW] Enhanced paren-matching. Moving the cursor on a closing
;;    paren in Normal mode now highlights the opening paren.
;;  - [NEW] Pressing RET in Insert mode automatically indents the new
;;    line.
;;  - [NEW] ^[ works.
;;  - [FIX] a<ESC> leaves the cursor in the same location as it was
;;    before (it advanced the cursor 1 character before --
;;    `viper-exit-insert-state's fault).
;;  - [FIX] cW doesn't suck anymore at the end of a line.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.3:
;;  [frank.fischer at s2001.tu-chemnitz.de:]
;;  - Support more Visual Block mode features: insert, append, delete,
;;    yank, change.
;;  - Change some Vimpulse and Viper functions to handle Block mode
;;    properly.
;;  - Update documentation to reflect Visual Block mode.
;;  - The = key in Visual mode calls `indent-region'.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.2:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Improved XEmacs compatibility.
;;  - Small documentation improvements.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.1:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Removed duplicate definition of `vimpulse-detect-mark-deactivate'
;;    and duplicate `add-hook' call to add the hook. I must have added
;;    the extra copies by accident when doing my last big merge; now
;;    they are gone.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.0:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Merged a patch for the function that powers * and #. Based on
;;    Ryoichi's patch and a cleaned-up version of Weihua's patch --
;;    thanks. Now * and # will search for entire symbol at point,
;;    including underscores, not just word at point.
;;  - TODO addition.
;;
;; Version 0.2.5.1:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Redefined viper-adjust-undo to do nothing. This way, in Insert
;;    mode, typing then moving the cursor then typing more counts as
;;    two separately undoable actions instead of one. Thanks to Weihua
;;    JIANG and to max_ from IRC #emacs for the idea.
;;  - Small extra TODO.
;;
;; Version 0.2.5.0:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  I've ignored my local changes for too long. Here they are:
;;  - Added keybindings from a Usenet post by Samuel Padgett.
;;  - Made change (cw, etc.) commands work more like Vim (my code).
;;  - I removed (setq ex-cycle-other-window nil); although it is very
;;    useful, it merely works around a problem with Viper. I plan to
;;    discuss it with the Viper maintainer instead.
;;  - Other changes and bugfixes from various people.
;;
;; Version 0.2.0.3:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Added Brad's `viper-jump-to-tag-at-point'.
;;
;; Version 0.2.0.2:
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Small C-w keys and doc fixes.
;;
;; Version 0.2.0.1:
;;  [cppjavaperl:]
;;  - Added support for Visual Block mode (i.e., rectangle selection).
;;  - Made C-p look for matches *prior* to the cursor and added C-n
;;    binding to look for matches *before* the cursor. This works more
;;    like Vim does.
;;  [jasonspiro3 at gmail.com:]
;;  - Since Vimpulse has no website, I added a prominent pointer at
;;    the top to the installation instructions.
;;
;; Version 0.2.0.0: Brad merged in several changes, including:
;;  - Exit Visual mode when the mark deactivates.
;;  - Changed the window manipulation to be global.
;;  - Added gf (goto file at point).
;;  - Added \C-] and \C-t, tag jump & pop.
;;  - Added a helper function for defining keys.
;;  - Commented out `show-paren-function', what is it meant to do?
;;
;; Version 0.1.0.1: No code changes. Small documentation changes,
;; including updates on moving-left bug.
;;
;; Version 0.1: Initial release.
