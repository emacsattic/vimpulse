;;; Commentary:

;; Vimpulse emulates Vim's most popular features, like Visual mode
;; and text objects.  Vimpulse is a set of modifications to Viper, the
;; standard library that emulates vi.  Vimpulse is not a minor mode;
;; as soon as it is loaded, Viper will start working in a more
;; Vim-like way.
;;
;; Vimpulse is under active development.  It works quite well with
;; GNU Emacs 22.3 and 23.2, as well as XEmacs 21.4.22.  Patches and
;; feature requests are welcome.
