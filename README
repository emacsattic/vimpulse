;;; Usage:

;; To use Visual mode, press v in vi (command) mode.  Then use the
;; motion commands to expand the selection.  Press d to delete, c to
;; change, r to replace, or y to copy.  You can use p to paste.  For
;; Line selection, press V instead of v; then you can copy and paste
;; whole lines.  For Block selection, press C-v; now you can copy and
;; paste the selected rectangle.  In Block selection, you may use
;; I or A to insert or append text before or after the selection on
;; each line.
;;
;; Other features:
;;
;; Vimpulse supports text objects: daw, daW, das, dap, dab, daB, da(,
;; da[, da{, da<, da", da', as well as diw, diW, dis, etc.  To change
;; an object: caw, cas, etc.  To yank it: yaw, yas, etc.  To select it:
;; vaw, vas, etc.

;; The extended documentation is still in its early stages, but you
;; can view drafts at
;;
;; http://trac-git.assembla.com/vimpulse/wiki/Documentation
;;
;; The documentation that comes with Vim -- which is online at
;; http://vimdoc.sf.net/ -- may also be helpful.
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; - Vimpulse makes C-r run Redo in command mode, but you can
;;   still get reverse isearch by pressing C-s and then C-r.
;;
;; - To change the color of search, add something like the following
;;   to .emacs:
;;
;;       (set-face-foreground isearch nil)
;;       (set-face-background isearch "lightgoldenrod2")
;;
;; - To change the color of Visual mode (`zmacs-region' in XEmacs):
;;
;;       (set-face-background 'region "blue")
